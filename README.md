# Fragment-communication-Using-Interface-using-Shared-ViewModel.

Create an Android app with the following features

The app should have 2 Activities.
Activity1 & Activity2 should have 2 Fragments in them with a button & text view. OnClick of FragmentA's button FragmentB's text should change & onClick of FragmentB's button FragmentA's text should change.
Activity1 -> Fragment communication should happen using interfaces.
Activity2 -> Fragment communication should happen using Shared ViewModel.
Note: Also implement all fragment lifecycle methods and add logs to notice how fragment lifecycle behaves.
